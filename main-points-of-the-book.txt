This is true in personal finance, where you’re told to have a six-month
emergency fund and save 10% of your salary
Two topics impact everyone, whether you are interested in them or not: health
and money.
Physics isn’t controversial. It’s guided by laws. Finance is different.
It’s guided by people’s behaviors. And how I behave might make sense to me
but look crazy to you.
I love Voltaire’s observation that “History never repeats itself; man always
does.” It applies so well to how we behave with money.

Everyone has their own unique experience with how the world works. And what
you’ve experienced is more compelling than what you learn second-hand. So all
of us—you, me, everyone—go through life anchored to a set of views about how
money works that vary wildly from person to person. What seems crazy to you
might make sense to me.

Your personal experiences with money make up maybe 0.00000001% of what’s
happened in the world, but maybe 80% of how you think the world works. So
equally smart people can disagree about how and why recessions happen, how
you should invest your money, what you should prioritize, how much risk you
should take, and so on

The challenge for us is that no amount of studying or open-mindedness can
genuinely recreate the power of fear and uncertainty.

Spreadsheets can model the historic frequency of big stock market declines. But
they can’t model the feeling of coming home, looking at your kids, and
wondering if you’ve made a mistake that will impact their lives. Studying
history makes you feel like you understand something. But until you’ve lived
through it and personally felt its consequences, you may not understand it
enough to change your behavior.

We all think we know how the world works. But we’ve all only experienced a
tiny sliver of it.
The economists wrote: “Our findings suggest that individual investors’
willingness to bear risk depends on personal history.”
Not intelligence, or education, or sophistication. Just the dumb luck of when and
where you were born.

But every financial decision a person makes, makes sense to them in that
moment and checks the boxes they need to check. They tell themselves a story
about what they’re doing and why they’re doing it, and that story has been
shaped by their own unique experiences.

You don’t have to agree with this reasoning. Buying lotto tickets when you’re
broke is still a bad idea. But I can kind of understand why lotto ticket sales
persist.
And that idea—“What you’re doing seems crazy but I kind of understand why
you’re doing it.”—uncovers the root of many of our financial decisions.

It should surprise no one that many of us are bad at saving and investing for
retirement. We’re not crazy. We’re all just newbies.

Luck and risk are both the reality that every outcome in life is guided by forces
other than individual effort. They are so similar that you can’t believe in one
without equally respecting the other. They both happen because the world is too
complex to allow 100% of your actions to dictate 100% of your outcomes. 

They are driven by the same thing: You are one person in a game with seven billion
other people and infinite moving parts. The accidental impact of actions outside
of your control can be more consequential than the ones you consciously take.

For every Bill Gates there is a Kent Evans who was just as skilled
and driven but ended up on the other side of life roulette.
